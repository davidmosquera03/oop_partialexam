## Explaining UML Class Diagram
As Libraries contain Books, I create my first 2 classes

1. Library that can cointain objects of the class Book.

2. a Book has a name and status.

Two other important classes include:

3. User, who accesses books to borrow them and may damage or lose them. Also searches for available books.

4. Librarian, the one who gives the Library its books and can take individually or in groups
